The SWAMP Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program (Program) and the Safe to Eat Workgroup (STEW) are highly collaborative - and we are always looking for new collaborators and partners!\n\n\n\nTo the right is a visual representation of the partners currently in our network. Below we include discriptions of and links to related partner program websites.\n\n\n\nNetwork map of STEW and Program partners\n\n\n\n\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratories' (MLML) Marine Pollution Studies Laboratory (MPSL): Our MLML/MPSL partners lead the sample collection and processing efforts.\nSan Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI): Our SFEI partners lead the data analysis, interpretation and reporting process, and help Co-chair the STEW!\n\n\n\nSWAMP Regional Monitoring Programs: Many Regional SWAMP Programs augment the efforts of the Statewide Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program, or conduct bioaccumulation related studies of their own to address regionally-specific water quality concerns.\nSWAMP Information Management and Quality Assurance Center (SWAMP IQ): SWAMP IQ conducts a thorough quality assurance review and verification of all of our data before adding the data to our public data systems.\nSWAMP Statewide Freshwater and Estuarine Harmful Algal Bloom (FHAB) Program: We're working with the FHAB Program to better understand the nexus between harmful algal blooms and bioaccumulation risks.\nSWAMP eDNA Metabarcoding Monitoring and Analysis Project (SeMMAP): We're beginning to work with SeMMAP to better understand the extent to which environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used to support our monitoring efforts. \n\n\n\nWhenever possible, we try to collaborate with other bioaccumulation monitoring programs, including:\n\nRegional Monitoring Program for Water Quality in San Francisco Bay (Bay RMP)\nSouthern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program (Bight RMP)\nThe Delta Regional Monitoring Program (Delta RMP)\nMarine Biotoxin Monitoring Program (monitoring of marine bivalve shellfish)\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife\nUS EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys\n\nThe National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA)\nThe National Lakes Assessment (NLA)\nThe National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA)\nThe National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA)\n\nBiomonitoring California\n\n\n\n\nWe work closely with other CA State Agencies to make sure our data is used to protect public health, and is communicated effectively in the public health space so that those that are most impacted by consuming contaminated fish and shellfish can make informed decisions to reduce their exposure to harmful pollutants in fish and shellfish.\n\nThe Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) is the lead state agency for the assessment of health risks posed by environmental contaminants. OEHHA uses our data to develop site specific and statewide fish advisories. \nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is the state department responsible for public health in California. We're building stronger relationships with some of their programs (e.g., Center for Healthy Communities) to more efficiently and effectively achieve our respective missions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards), collectively known as the California Water Boards (Water Boards) are dedicated to a single mission:\n\nTo preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California's water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\nUnder the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the state’s pioneering Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State and Regional Water Boards have regulatory responsibility for protecting the water quality of nearly 1.6 million acres of lakes, 1.3 million acres of bays and estuaries, 211,000 miles of rivers and streams, and about 1,100 miles of exquisite California coastline! \nThere are a number of programs that partner with us and/or use our data to inform their work, including:\n\nTribal Affairs and their Tribal Beneficial Use efforts\nStatewide Mercury Control Program\nIntegrated Report Program\nTMDL Programs\nBacteria Objectives\nBiostimulation, Cyanotoxins, and Biological Condition Provisions\nOcean Standards Unit\nWetlands Program\nConstituents of Emerging Concern (CEC)\nPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)\n\nVisit our Data Use page for more details on how our data are used in some of these programs to protect and restore water quality in California.\n\n\nCalifornia Indian Environmental Alliance (CIEA): We work closely with our CIEA partners on a number of bioaccumulation related projects. CIEA is also an active member of the STEW!\nWe're working on building more relationships with California Native American Tribes through the Program's equity initiatives. See the FAQ for more information on how tribes and tribal organizations can engage with the Program and/or the STEW.\n\n\n\nEquity Workgroup: STEW Co-chairs are actively involved with this Workgroup and its efforts to operationalize equity in all levels of the Council.\nWe're working on building stronger partnerships with the following Workgroups:\n\nCalifornia Cyanobacteria and Harmful Algal Bloom (CCHAB) Network\nCalifornia Estuary Monitoring Workgroup\nCalifornia Water Quality Monitoring Collaboration Network\nCalifornia Wetland Monitoring Workgroup\nHealthy Watersheds Partnership\nCalifornia Ocean & Coastal Ecosystem Workgroup\n\n\n\n\nWe're working on building more relationships with the academic community so we can leverage our partnerships, advance needed research, and connect with emerging academics and future scientists and leaders of California! Partner academic institutions include:\n\nCSU-WATER (Water Advocacy for Education and Research)\n\nCSU Northridge Water Science Lab\n\nCSU COAST (Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology)\n\nAre you at an academic institution conducting research related to bioaccumulation, fish advisory development, and/or statewide bioaccumulation monitoring efforts - but are not included in the list above?
